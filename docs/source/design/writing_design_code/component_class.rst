Writing Component Classes
*************************

This section will show you how to design your own water treatment plant
component. A component is any component of the plant, and for coding them these
classes will extend the Component class. These classes must extend the
Component class as it will allow the sharing of certain properties such as flow
rate, temperature with the subcomponents of those classes. For example, when
making a whole plant, the flow rate should be constant between every single
subcomponent. For the rest of this section, we will learn how to make the Monroe
Component ``class Monroe(Component):``. To see the component class check out 
:class:`aguaclara.design.component.Component`. Also make sure to import the necessary 
classes and packages for your component, this includes importing the Component 
class.

Class Variables
===============

.. code-block:: python

    BEAN_DENSITY = 4.0 * u.g / u.L

``BEANS_DENSITY`` is a class variable (unlike the instance variables defined
in ``__init__()``) and should remain constant. The all-caps indicates that it
shouldn't be changed.

* To access it from within the class, use ``self.BEANS_DENSITY``.
* To access it from outside of the class, import the class and use
  ``Monroe.BEANS_DENSITY``.

``__init__()``
==============

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):

The ``__init__()`` function is used to create an object. Every time you declare
a new class, Python automatically creates this function behind the scenes, but
for the most part, you want to also declare it yourself to cancel out the one
that Python makes. Instead of running ``Monroe.__init__(your_design_inputs)``,
you can just run ``Monroe(your_design_inputs)`` to create an instance of the
``Monroe`` class (also known as a ``Monroe`` object).

``self`` is a keyword that refers to the instantiated object. All class
functions need to have ``self`` written as the first parameter, but you won't
need it at all outside of where the class is declared. ``self`` also allows you
to access all of the fields and functions in your class - more on that later.

``**kwargs`` is short for "keyword arguments". If you were to define a function
as:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(bar=10, zardoz='hello world', **kwargs):
        ...
        
And then if you were to run it as:

.. code-block:: python

    foo(bar=20, water='infinity')

``bar=10``, ``zardoz='hello world'``, ``bar=20``, and ``water='infinity'`` are
all considered to be keyword arguments, since they're attached to a keyword
name. However, since ``water`` isn't declared in the function, it gets sent to
the ``kwargs`` dictionary, which can then be used within the function (more on
dictionaries `here
<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp>`_). (`Why is there a
\**? <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1769478>`_)

In our case of writing design code, ``**kwargs`` is used to gather all of the
design inputs for a component and use them in the component's calculations. The
call ``Monroe(q = 1 * u.L/u.s)`` will send ``q`` into ``kwargs``, which can then
be accessed via ``kwargs['q']`` inside of ``__init__()``.

Inside ``__init__()``
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Part 1
    self.rice_and_beans_eaten = 5.0 * u.L
    self.pc = PressureCooker()
    # Part 2
    super().__init__(**kwargs)
    # Part 3
    self.subcomponents = [self.pc]
    super().set_subcomponents()

The purpose of the ``__init__`` body is to assign all of the design inputs into
instance variables of the object.  

Part 1: Assigning Component-Wide Properties
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. code-block:: python

    self.rice_and_beans_eaten = 5.0 * u.L
    self.pc = PressureCooker()

These design inputs for this component are component-wide properties, and
aren't used in other areas unless it's a subcomponent. The lines above assign
the design inputs, apart from q and temp, to now be properties of the component
(in this case Monroe). When instantiating these design inputs you should assign 
it a default value, which can be changed by a keyword arg.

In later functions, you can use these properties by writing ``self.<property
name>``. When figuring out how to name your design inputs, refer to
:ref:`coding-conventions`.  

Part 2: Assigning Plant-Wide Properties and Changing Design Inputs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. code-block:: python

    super().__init__(**kwargs)

The design inputs flow rate and water temperature are plant-wide properties, as
they are constant throughout the whole plant. By using the init function from
the Component Class, it not only instantiates these properties to the component
but also allows the component's subcomponents to utilize the same ``q`` and
``temp``. 

This code also changes the other design inputs if the user added a keyword arg 
that would change a property. For instance, if someone did 
``Monroe(rice_and_beans_eaten = 20 * u.L)`` then the design input from part 1 
will be changed from 5L to 20L with the component's init function.

In later functions, you can use the ``q`` and ``temp`` by writing ``self.q`` and
``self.temp``.

Part 3: Propogating Configurations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. code-block:: python

    self.subcomponents = [self.pc]
    super().set_subcomponents()

In order to propogate configurations to Monroe's subcomponents, you first have
to make a variable ``self.subcomponents`` which is a list of all of your
subcomponents(in this case ``self.pc``). Then when you call the second line in
Part 3, the functions looks at your subcomponent and propogates the
configurations. This includes ``q``, ``temp`` and any keyword arguments
specifically called on the subcomponent. So if someone wrote ``Monroe(pc =
PressureCooker(rice_and_beans_ratio = 2))``, ``Monroe.pc.rice_and_beans_ratio``
will now evaluate to 2 and not 0.5.

Property Functions
==================

.. code-block:: python

    @property
    def h(self):
        """The height."""
        h = self.q * (0.06414368184 * u.s / u.m ** 2) * self.pc.rice_and_beans_ratio
        return h.to(u.ft)

For a component, they're some properties that don't stem from design inputs, and
could rely on some calculation. These properties can then be made through a
property function. Property functions have no extra args, and allow for the
calling of a property function to be the same as a normal property.

Using the above example, you can use ``self.h`` to call on the ``h`` function
(no parentheses needed). This is done by writing ``@property`` above your
function. For these functions remember to follow :ref:`coding-conventions`.

How to Make a Subcomponent
==========================

.. code-block:: python

    class PressureCooker(Component):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            self.rice_and_beans_ratio = 0.5
            super().__init__(**kwargs)

        def rb_per_person(self, people_n, time_to_eat):
            rb_per_person = self.q * self.rice_and_beans_ratio * time_to_eat / people_n
            return rb_per_person

The code block above is the code for Monroe's subcomponent, his pressure cooker.
The things to note here is a subcomponent is exactly the same as a normal
component. To make a subcomponent, you have to affect the main component.

In order to make a component a subcomponent:

#. Add the subcomponent as a design input
#. Make a ``self.subcomponets`` variable with a list of it's subcomponents
#. Set those subcomponents with ``super().set_subcomponents()``

Ex: Making PressureCooker a Subcomponent of Monroe
--------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.rice_and_beans_eaten = 5.0 * u.L,
        self.pc = PressureCooker() # Step 1: Add pc as design input

        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self.subcomponents = [self.pc] # Step 2: Make self.subcomponets variable with a list of it's subcomponents
        super().set_subcomponents() # Step 3: Set those subcomponents with super().set_subcomponents()

Try it out for yourself!
========================

Now that you know how to write component design classes, it is time for you to
put that knowledge to the test and design your own ``Oliver`` design class!

The ``Oliver`` class must have the following specification:

* A constant ``LOVE_FOR_COFFEE``, set to ``1000``
* An ``__init__()`` function with the following expert inputs:
    * ``self.chromebook`` (defaults to the default instance of a ``Chromebook``
      class)
    * ``self.supression_rate`` (defaults to 0.7 meter / second) *
    * ``puns_per_day`` (choose your own default, but the units should be meter /
      day)
* A ``@property`` function ``love_of_boba`` which uses ``q``,
  ``suppression_rate`` and ``LOVE_FOR_COFFEE`` in the calculation 
* A ``@property`` function ``olratio``, that uses ``puns_per_day``
* A function that takes in a ``chromebook_failure_chance`` argument and uses the
  fields of ``self.chromebook`` to tell me how trash his chromebook is

Write the ``Chromebook`` class above the ``Oliver`` class with the following
specification

* An ``__init__()`` function with the following expert inputs:
    * ``crashes_per_day`` (defaults to 100 * u.s ** -1)

You should write this class in a code block of a Google Colab notebook that 
begins with ``!pip install aguaclara``:

.. code-block:: python

    from aguaclara.play import *

    class Chromebook(Component):
        ...

    class Oliver(Component):
        ...

You can then test the class out by instantiating an ``Oliver`` and calling its
functions:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> oliver = Oliver()
    >>> oliver.q
    20 liter/second

Remember to reference the ``Monroe`` class below if you're stuck!
